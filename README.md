# ðŸŽ² Dice Game Web App

A browser-based two-player dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players roll virtual dice by clicking a button, and the game automatically updates scores, displays the winner, and handles ties.

This project was created as part of **Dr. Angela Yu's "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp"** on Udemy. It served as a hands-on introduction to JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and interactive web page design.

## Features
